            <p class="medieval">
                Houses at Hogwarts are both the living and learning communities for its students. Each year's group of students in the same House shares the same dormitory and many classes. The houses compete throughout the school year, by earning and losing points for behaviour. The House with the most points wins the House Cup. Each House also has its own Quidditch team that competes for the Inter-House Quidditch Cup.
            </p>
            <p class="medieval">
                In the early days of Hogwarts, the four founders handpicked students for their Houses. When the founders worried how students would be selected after their deaths, Godric Gryffindor took his hat off and each "put some brains" in it, creating the Sorting Hat to choose future students for each House. At the beginning of each school year, the magical Sorting Hat is placed on each new student's head during the Sorting ceremony.
                The Sorting Hat announces the House the student is to join. Before beginning the Sorting ceremony, it sings a short song about the founding of the school and the four Houses; the Sorting Hat's songs are different every year, and the Hat is said to take all year composing the next one.

                    Hufflepuff corresponds to the element of earth. The Hufflepuff dormitories and common room can be accessed by
                    tapping the barrel two from the bottom, middle of the second row in the rhythm of "Helga Hufflepuff" and is
                    described as being a cosy and welcoming place with yellow hangings, fat armchairs, and underground tunnels that lead
                    to the dormitories, which have perfectly round doors, similar to barrel tops. Famous Hufflepuffs include Hengist of
                    Woodcroft (founder of Hogsmeade), Newt Scamander (author of Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them), and Artemisia
                    Lufkin (first female minister for magic).

                    Established around the 10th century, Hogwarts was considered to be one of the finest magical institutions in
                    the Wizarding World, though other notable schools included Beauxbatons Academy of Magic in France, the
                    Durmstrang Institute implied to be in northern Europe, and Ilvermorny School of Witchcraft and Wizardry in

                    child and his or her family in order to inform them of their magical heritage and the existence of the

                    <h3>Early</h3>
                    <p>
                        Hogwarts was founded around 990 A.D. by four of the greatest wizards and witches of the age: Godric
                        Gryffindor, Helga Hufflepuff, Rowena Ravenclaw, and Salazar Slytherin. They each represented an aspect
                        of personality that they wanted to bring out in new students. However, shortly after founding the
                        school, Slytherin had a falling out with the other founders about blood purity, and wanted to admit only
                        pure-blood students. He felt pure-blooded students deserved to learn magic, and those of other ancestry
                        such as Muggle-borns and Half-bloods, were unworthy. The other three founders all disagreed, especially
                        Gryffindor. Slytherin left the school, but not before secretly building the Chamber of Secrets. He
                        foretold that only his own heir would be able to open it once they arrived at the school, and the heir
                        would unleash a murderous basilisk living inside to purge the school of all Muggle-born students.

                    <p>
                        About three hundred years after the school was founded, the Triwizard Tournament was established as an
                        interscholastic competition between three of the most prestigious magical schools in Europe: Hogwarts,
                        Beauxbatons (France), and Durmstrang (An undetermined Northern European country). This tournament was
                        considered the best way for wizards and witches of different nationalities to meet and socialise. The
                        tournament continued for six centuries, until the death toll became too high. The tournament was
                        discontinued until 1994.

                        On 29 November 1926, the Daily Prophet reported that security had to be increased at Hogwarts in
                        response to the growing threat of Gellert Grindelwald's impact on the Global wizarding war. Measures
                        included Headmaster Armando Dippet holding an emergency meeting with worried parents and students being
                        sent home early.

                    <h3>1942-1943</h3>
                    <p>
                        The existence of the school was threatened twice when the Chamber of Secrets was opened. The first time
                        it was opened
                        was in 1942, when Tom Marvolo Riddle, the Heir of Slytherin and the man who would become Lord Voldemort,
                        opened the
                        Chamber in his fifth year.
        
                        When a girl named Myrtle Warren was killed, the Ministry of Magic threatened to close the school. As
                        Riddle spent his
                        time away from Hogwarts in a Muggle orphanage, he did not want the school closed. His request to remain
                        in school over
                        the holidays was denied due to the situation he created. Upset with himself, he framed Rubeus Hagrid,
                        and although Albus
                        Dumbledore still suspected Riddle, Hagrid was expelled, and Riddle got off without punishment. However,
                        in 1992, the
                        Chamber was reopened, and it was discovered that Hagrid was innocent and Riddle was guilty.

                    <h3>1970-1990</h3>
                    <p>
                        Throughout the entirety of the First Wizarding War, which lasted for eleven long years and caused much
                        distress among the students, Hogwarts Castle was perhaps the only safe haven in wizarding Britain, due
                        to the presence of Albus Dumbledore. Dumbledore had risen to the post of Headmaster, and was the only
                        one whom Voldemort was ever afraid of.
                        By the end of the 1970s, Lord Voldemortâ€™s ascendancy was almost complete. While the Ministry of Magic
                        did their best to both put up a fight and keep wizardkind a secret, a true resistance to him was being
                        concentrated in the underground organisation founded by Dumbledore himself called the Order of the
                        Phoenix. Several former students at the school went on to join the order. On Hallowe'en of the 1981-1982
                        school year, news would have reached the school of the fall of Lord Voldemort and his failed attempt at
                        murdering the infant Harry Potter, after which students and staff alike would have celebrated the fall
                        of the Dark Lord.

                    <p>
                        In 1991, Harry Potter began his career as a student at Hogwarts. Already famous for being believed to be responsible for vanquishing Lord Voldemort at the age of one, he soon began, with the help of his friends Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger, to unravel the secret of the Philosopher's Stone being kept at the school. Harry discovered that the Defence Against the Dark Arts Professor, Quirinus Quirrell, was a host body for the barely-alive Voldemort, who wanted to use the Stone to restore himself back to his former glory and gain everlasting life.

                        In 1994, Hogwarts played host to the infamous Triwizard Tournament, this time with more powerful safety measures in place. However, more dark plots were being hatched. Barty Crouch Jnr, disguised as Alastor "Mad-Eye" Moody, managed to enter Harry in the Tournament by putting his name in the Goblet of Fire under the name of a fourth school, which ensured he would be chosen by the Goblet. It was because of Crouch Jnr and his influence over certain house-elves that Harry ended up surviving until the end of the tournament and reaching the goal of the Third Task, along with fellow Hogwarts student Cedric Diggory. On Voldemort's orders, Diggory was killed by Pettigrew, and Harry was surrounded by Death Eaters in Little Hangleton Graveyard. Voldemort was brought back to his physical form using Harry's blood and the Resurrection Stone.

                        Through the 1996-1997 school year, the new Minister for Magic Rufus Scrimgeour ordered Aurors to guard Hogwarts for protection from Dark forces, along with the castle's defences being fortified in many ways. In 1997, Hogwarts was attacked by a mob of Death Eaters. Lucius Malfoy's son Draco was forced into the service of Lord Voldemort for fear of his and his family's lives. As a result, Headmaster Dumbledore's safety was compromised, and he was killed by Severus Snape, in a secret coup de grace arranged in advance between them. Following this "horrible" tragedy, Professor Minerva McGonagall was appointed acting Headmistress, though the security of the school hung by a thread. There was no certainty that Hogwarts would remain open. However, when Draco succeeded in allowing the Death Eaters entrance, the full effect came to be when many parents rushed their children home, fearing that even Hogwarts, reputably the safest location in the wizarding world, was no longer safe from Voldemort.

                    <h3>After 1998</h3>
                    <p>
                        In May 1998, the Battle of Hogwarts took place as one of its most infamous alumni, Tom Riddle, better known by then as Lord Voldemort, returned to attack the school and subdue or destroy its defenders. Voldemort claimed he had no desire to harm the school or its students, but he and his Death Eaters spared no one who opposed them and recklessly damaged the school during their assault.
                        Numerous students, staff, parents, graduates, and friends of Hogwarts rose to the school's defence in its hour of need, including the notorious poltergeist Peeves. Thanks to Harry Potter, Lord Voldemort was permanently destroyed and his Death Eaters disbanded forever. Minerva McGonagall became the Headmistress of the school. Hogwarts sustained extensive damage during the battle. Multiple areas of the main building and adjacent areas were set on fire or blown up, and the Quidditch pitch was largely destroyed by fire.

        <div class="textGold">

            <p class="medieval">
                A powerful wizard is one that casts powerful spells. Powerful spells are the result of casting the spells well. Casting a spell well results from a wizard's skill at magic. Thus, a powerful wizard is one with a high level of skill.
            </p>
            <p class="medieval">
                It was believed that pure-bloods are inherently more powerful wizards, but some of the most powerful or particularly adept wizards and witches are in fact either half-blood (such as Lord Voldemort, Albus Dumbledore, Minerva McGonagall, Severus Snape and Harry Potter) or Muggle-born (such as Hermione Granger and Lily Evans).

                    Hogwarts is located in the Scottish Highlands, near the all-wizard village of Hogsmeade and "not far" from Dufftown, in Moray, and Achintee, in Lochaber. Hogwarts is built in a valley area â€” surrounding mountains were part of the landscape â€” with the fairly large Great Lake to the south of the main building. The huge main oak front doors that leads into the Entrance Hall faces west, and opens up to sloping lawns. The deep Forbidden Forest extends around to the west of the castle.There are also exterior greenhouses and vegetable patches on the school grounds.

                <div>The Hogwarts Express is the name of the train that runs between London King's Cross Station Platform 9Â¾ and
                    Hogsmeade station. It makes this run about six times a year, maybe more, as needed. The Express dutifully carries
                    students to and from Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry at the start and end of every term.
                    The train leaves Platform 9Â¾ without fail every 1 September at 11 o'clock in the morning, arriving at Hogsmeade
                    station in the early evening. Students can take the train back to King's Cross Station to go home for the Christmas
                    and Easter holidays, or they can stay at Hogwarts. It also makes the run back again to London at the
                    end of term in June.</div>
