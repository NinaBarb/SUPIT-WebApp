                "The Elder Wand," he said, and he drew a straight vertical line on the parchment. "The Resurrection Stone," he said, and he added a circle on top of the line. "The Cloak of Invisibility," he finished, enclosing both line and circle in a triangle, to make the symbol that so intrigued Hermione. "Together," he said, "the Deathly Hallows."

                The Deathly Hallows are three highly powerful magical objects supposedly created by Death and given to each
                of three brothers in the Peverell family. They consisted of the Elder Wand, an immensely powerful wand that
                was considered unbeatable; the Resurrection Stone, a stone which could summon the spirits of the dead, and
                the Cloak of Invisibility, which, as its name suggests, renders the user completely invisible. According to
                the story, both Antioch Peverell (owner of the Wand) and Cadmus Peverell (owner of the Stone) came to bad
                ends. However, Ignotus Peverell's wisdom in requesting the Cloak was rewarded. According to legend, he who possesses these three artefacts would become the Master of Death. Dumbledore told Harry that he and another wizard, Gellert Grindelwald took this to mean that the uniter of the Deathly Hallows would be invincible. The story of the Deathly Hallows was originally told by Beedle the Bard and subsequently passed from family to family as a wizard fairytale. Few wizards ever realised that the Deathly Hallows were genuine items. Most people thought that there were things that Beedle had made up to entertain young wizards and witches.
                No one but Harry Potter has been known to have been in command of all three at the same time, though he was
                never in possession of them all at once (he dropped the stone in the Forbidden Forest just before gaining
                the wand that he had won the alliance of in a previous scuffle at Malfoy Manor). Albus Dumbledore had also
                possessed all three, but not all at once, much like Harry, as he was never the true owner of the Cloak.
