        <h1>Sorting ceremony</h1>
    
        <p>Are you Gryffindor? Are you Hufflepuff? Are you Slytherin? Are you Ravenclaw?
    
            Find out with the Hogwarts Sorting Experience created by J.K. Rowling.
    
            Now, we’re assuming you’re more than familiar with the four houses of Hogwarts, but here’s a quick refresher,
            just in case.
    
            Hogwarts was founded over a thousand years ago by four powerful wizards: Godric Gryffindor, Salazar Slytherin,
            Rowena Ravenclaw and Helga Hufflepuff. They chose to split the students into four ‘houses’, each bearing their
            surnames and featuring young wizards and witches who displayed abilities and personalities they wanted to
            nurture.
    
            To do this, Godric Gryffindor used his magical hat – henceforward known as the Sorting Hat – to decide which
            children should go into which house, and so it has been ever since with a yearly Sorting Ceremony that places
            each new pupil into their own new home.
    
            The four houses have different entry requirements, and nobody summed them up better than the old Sorting Hat
            itself in its welcoming song...
            <br><br>
            "Oh you may not think I'm pretty,
            But don't judge on what you see,
            I'll eat myself if you can find
            A smarter hat than me.
    
            You can keep your bowlers black,
            Your top hats sleek and tall,
            For I'm the Hogwarts Sorting Hat
            And I can cap them all.
    
            There's nothing hidden in your head
            The Sorting Hat can't see,
            So try me on and I will tell you
            Where you ought to be.
    
            You might belong in Gryffindor,
            Where dwell the brave at heart,
            Their daring, nerve, and chivalry
            Set Gryffindors apart;
    
            You might belong in Hufflepuff,
            Where they are just and loyal,
            Those patient Hufflepuffs are true
            And unafraid of toil;
    
            Or yet in wise old Ravenclaw,
            if you've a ready mind,
            Where those of wit and learning,
            Will always find their kind;
    
            Or perhaps in Slytherin
            You'll make your real friends,
            Those cunning folks use any means
            To achieve their ends.
    
            So put me on! Don't be afraid!
            And don't get in a flap!
            You're in safe hands (though I have none)
            For I'm a Thinking Cap!
